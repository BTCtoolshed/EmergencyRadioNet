# Emergency Radio Net
Version 1.0 of an emergency radio protocol for your community

A technically minded person (preferably a licensed Ham radio operator for testing purposes, but not necessary) can use this protocol to program cheap Baofeng radios, distribute them to the community, run tests and then operate in an emergency using preassigned coded messages. A coordinator should program radios for the community, devise callsigns for members, keep records of these callsigns (see above in the downloads), test repeater ranges for each member's AO. 

To program a Baofend, download and change the information for the repeaters (highlighted in document) in the Emergency Comms Plan Template document above. Download CHIRP (https://chirpmyradio.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home), and then download and open the CHIRP image for the UV5R above. Use CHIRP to change or delete the last 4 "channels" to be your local repeaters. You will need a data cable for the Baofeng in order to use CHIRP.

Lastly, to use unlicensed frequences like MURS/FMRS (GMRS low power), you need to factory reset your Baofeng. With the radio off, hold PTT, Moni, VFO buttons and roll the volume knob up to turn on. Hold until you see Factory Reset.
