# Emergency Radio Net
Version 1.0 of an emergency radio protocol for your community

A technically minded person (preferably a licensed Ham radio operator, but not necessary) can use this protocol to program cheap Baofeng radios, distribute them to the community, run tests and then operate in an emergency using preassigned coded messages. All instructions are in the documents of this repository.

You can program Baofengs with the CHIRP program. Just google it. You'll need a data cable for it to work. The CHIRP image for the UV5R is in the documents here. It can be used to clone your radios, just make your changes for your area repeaters inside the CHIRP program.
