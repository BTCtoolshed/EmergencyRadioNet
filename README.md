# Emergency Radio Net
Version 1.0 of an emergency radio protocol for your community

A technically minded person (preferably a licensed Ham radio operator, but not necessary) can use this protocol to program cheap Baofeng radios, distribute them to the community, run tests and then operate in emergency using preassigned codes messages. All instructions are in the documents of this repository.
